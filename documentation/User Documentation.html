<p><i>Filer</i> is an automatic file organizer. It takes the files it's opened with or that are dropped on it and moves, renames, copies or does all sorts of other things with them according to rules created by the user.</p>
<p><i>Filer</i> is accompanied by <i>AutoFiler</i>. Instead of working on a set of files provided by the user, it can be started (automatically with Haiku) to monitor certain folders and deal with new files appearing there according to the user-defined rules.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="usage" name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>When started for the first time, you are asked if you'd like to have a few example rules by default. You can edit them to your needs or remove them altogether at any time. All settings and rules are saved in <span class="path">~/config/settings/Filer/</span>.</p>
<p>Once you have created some rules, using <i>Filer</i> to process files accordingly is very simple. There are basically four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>From a Terminal, simply type "<tt>Filer</tt>" followed by the files you want processed.</li>
<li>Select the files to process, right-click them and choose <span class="menu">Open with… | Filer</span> from Tracker's context menu.</li>
<li>Select the files to process and drag&amp;drop them on Filer's icon. You may want to create a link to <i>Filer</i> on the Desktop for that.</li>
<li>Open Filer, select the files to process and drag&amp;drop them onto the "Dropzone". The Dropzone can also be embedded into the Desktop as a Replicant.</li>
</ol>
<p>…or have <i>AutoFiler</i> monitor specific folders to automatically process their incoming files according to Filer's rules.</p>
<p>If <i>Filer</i> (or <i>AutoFiler</i> for that matter) encounters a conflict when moving or copying a file, i.e. there's already a file with that same name at the destination, a conflict window is shown (here about a file named 'TheFile'):</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="./images/conflict.png" alt="Conflict: File already exists" />
</div>
<p>You can either <span class="button">Skip</span> the move/copy of the file or <span class="button">Replace</span> the existing file. In case there are similar conflicts for the rest of the currently running Filer job, you can decide to <span class="button">Do this for all files</span> by ticking the checkbox before making your decision.<br />
Note, the state of the checkbox is only valid for the current Filer job. If <i>Filer</i> (or <i>AutoFiler</i>) is triggered at some later time and a conflict with an existing file occurs again, you are once more presented with this conflict window.</p>
<p>To decide if the file at the target folder should be replaced or the move/copy operation skipped instead, the size and the modified date of the file in the source and target folders are displayed beneath their paths.<br />
Left-click a path to open the file's parent folder in a Tracker window, where  the file in the target folder can be renamed or moved elsewhere.<br />
A right-click on a path offers a context menu with an item <span class="menu">Open file</span>, which opens the file in its preferred application. Very useful when comparing source and target images, for example.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Filer's interface is divided into four tabs: Rules, AutoFiler, Dropzone and Help.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="rules" name="rules">Rules</a></h2>
<div align="center">
<img src="./images/rules.png" alt="Filer's rules" />
</div>
<p>The first tab shows the list of organization rules. Every dropped file is being tested against — and if its type etc. matches, processed  by — each rule, top to bottom.</p>
<p>You can opt to <span class="menu">Apply only the first matching rule</span> if you prefer that. Filer will then stop trying to match rules to a file after it found one. (A rule can override that by adding a <span class="menu">Continue</span> in its "Then" block. See the <a href="Rule-Making%20Reference.html">Rule-Making Reference</a> for more info.)</p>
<p>You arrange the order of rules with the <span class="button">Move up/down</span> buttons. You can <span class="button">Edit…</span> and <span class="button">Disable</span> rules and add/remove a rule with the <span class="button">+</span> and <span class="button">-</span> buttons.</p>
<p>Here's the window that opens to edit a rule, which is similar to the one for adding a rule:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="./images/edit_rule.png" alt="Editing a rule" /></div>
<p>A rule needs three things: A <span class="menu">Description</span>, the condition deciding when it is applied ("<span class="menu">If</span>"), and what action to take ("<span class="menu">Then</span>").</p>
<p>Click on the pop-up menus in the "If" and "Then" boxes to explore the various options to construct the right condition and what action will be taken. You can add several conditions which will <i>all</i> have to be met to trigger the action. If you add several actions in the "Then" box, be aware that they are executed in order, from top to bottom.<br />
You add or remove a condition or action with its <span class="button">+</span> or <span class="button">-</span> buttons.</p>
<p>Conveniently, the text boxes support drag&amp;dropping of a file or folder. You can also click the folder icon which will open a file panel to navigate to your target. Depending on the kind of condition or action, the path, size, or file type etc. will be inserted.</p>
<p>Please read the <a href="Rule-Making%20Reference.html">Rule-Making Reference</a> (also available from the <span class="button">Help…</span> button) for more information on the various possibilities.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="autofiler" name="autofiler">AutoFiler</a></h2>
<p>When <i>AutoFiler</i> is running, it monitors user-defined folders and executes the actions defined in the <i>Filer</i> rules automatically.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="./images/autofiler.png" alt="AutoFiler settings" />
</div>
<p>The <i>AutoFiler</i> itself is a background application. You can activate the checkbox at the top to automatically <span class="menu">Run AutoFiler on system startup</span>. The button beside it lets you start/stop it manually.</p>
<p>With the <span class="button">+</span> and <span class="button">-</span> buttons, you can add and remove the folders that <i>AutoFiler</i> will monitor for incoming files. One or more folders are quickly added via drag&amp;drop.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="dropzone" name="dropzone">Dropzone</a></h2>
<div align="center">
<img src="./images/dropzone.png" alt="Filer's dropzone" />
</div>
<p>You can drag&amp;drop files onto the Dropzone to have them processed according to your set of rules. If you'd like to embed this Dropzone into the Desktop, click the button <span class="button">Replicate dropzone…</span>.<br />
It opens a window to resize the dropzone to fit your needs. When that's done, drag the little Replicant handle in the bottom-right corner onto your Desktop. Make sure to have <span class="menu">Show replicants</span> in the Deskbar menu activated. Once on the Desktop, right-click the Replicant's handle for a menu to remove it again.<br />
A right-click into the shaded part of the replicated Dropzone offers a menu as a shortcut to <span class="menu">Open Filer…</span>.</p>
<div class="box-info">
If you drag files from another partition onto a replicated Dropzone, you'll end up with copies of those files on your Desktop. This is because notifications of dropped files are not only processed by the Replicant, but also by the Tracker sitting below.</div>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="help" name="help">Help</a></h2>
<div align="center">
<img src="./images/help.png" alt="The help tab" />
</div>
<p>The last tab shows some information about <i>Filer</i> and offers two quick links to <span class="button">Help on rules</span> and the <span class="button">User documentation</span>.</p>
